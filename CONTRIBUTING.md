## Engaging with this project

Here are some important resources:
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nxfw-policy-tester/issues) - a place for bugs to be raised and feature requests made

### Coding Conventions

- In order to help verify the authenticity of contributed code, we ask that your [commits be signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). 
  All commits must be signed off to show that you agree to publish your changes under the current terms and licenses of the project.
  
  Here are some notes we found helpful in configuring a local environment to automatically sign git commits:
    - [GPG commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification)
    - [Telling Git about your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-gpg-key)
