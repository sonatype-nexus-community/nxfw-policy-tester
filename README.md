---

This is a simple test suite that will attempt to pull known *bad* packages into Proxy repositores in Sonatype Nexus Repository 
to allow customers to validate that Repository Firewall policies are operating as they expect.

This tool does not know the specific outcomes, as each Customer will have differing [Policy Actions](https://help.sonatype.com/en/policy-actions.html)
set.

This tool expects the [Reference Policy Set](https://help.sonatype.com/en/reference-policies.html) to be in use, but that is not mandatory.
